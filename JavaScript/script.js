var sentence = "<p>ONCE upon a time there was a prince named <i><b>"+name;
sentence+="</b></i> He was <i><b>"+adjective+"</b></i> who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess." ;
sentence+=" He travelled <i><b>"+verb+" </b></i>all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted.";
sentence+=" There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones.";
sentence+=" There was always something about<i><b> "+rand1+"</b></i> them that was not as it should be.";
sentence+=" So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.";
sentence+=" One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents.";
sentence+=" Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.";
sentence+=" It was a princess standing <i><b>"+rand2+"</b></i> out there in front of the gate.";
sentence+=" But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look.";
sentence+=" The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels.";
sentence+=" And yet she said that she was a real princess.</p>";

sentence+="<p>Well, we'll soon find that <i><b>"+noun+"</i></b> out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.Oh, very badly! said she. I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!";
sentence+="Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.";
sentence+="Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that. ";
sentence+="So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it. </p>";
